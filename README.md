python3 app.py
```

##  ML Model Implementation

### Training Process
1. **Data Collection**: Multiple face images per student
2. **Preprocessing**: Face detection, cropping, and normalization
3. **Feature Extraction**: Convert images to 1024-dimensional vectors
4. **Model Training**: Train Random Forest on feature-label pairs
5. **Model Persistence**: Save trained model for inference

### Feature Engineering Pipeline
```python
# Face preprocessing and feature extraction
def extract_features(image):
    # Convert to grayscale
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    # Detect faces
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.1, 4)
    
    # Crop and resize face
    face = cv2.resize(face, (32, 32))
    
    # Flatten to feature vector
    features = face.flatten().astype(np.float32) / 255.0
    
    return features  # 1024-dimensional vector
```

### Model Configuration
```python
# Random Forest Classifier
RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=150,      # Ensemble of 150 decision trees
    n_jobs=-1,            # Parallel processing
    random_state=42       # Reproducible results
)
```
